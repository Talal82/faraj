                        At the heart of every Emirati household are strong family values and the resolve to further enhance the rich Arabian culture and diverse community that surrounds us. This is especially true of the Bin Hamoodah family, whose roots in contributing towards the growth of the United Arab Emirates in almost every area of business stretches back as far as four decades.
